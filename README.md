# data_200_final_project
Logistic Regression model for predicting hypertension using NHANES 2015 - 2016 datasets.                    

The code includes using resampling and clustering methods to balance the dataset, implementing the model on imbalanced and balanced datasets using significant predictor variables, exploring lasso and ridge penalties, applying cross-validation, tuning the threshold, and visualizing the results.
