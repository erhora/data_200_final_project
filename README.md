DATA-200: Foundations of Data Analytics
Final Project Group 7
Group Members: Elizabeth Hora, Isaac Opiyo, Jiayi Zhang, Ziqi Zhou

Our work is based on the NHANES data, and we are studying which factors are important in predicting if a person has high blood pressure.

Each group member has a branch with their work inside.

This branch includes the KNN code and the plots in the hypertension prediction project. 

BPX2015_2016.XPT is from NHANES 2015-2016 Examination Data, Blood Pressure.
complete.rds is from Elizabeth's data-cleaning process
DataProcessing.Rmd is to drop NA and zero in the dataset by RStudio, then save it to a new dataset named Data2015_2016.csv
